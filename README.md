# Find-the-pattern-of-association-among-the-indicators
Using NARM along with genetic algorithm to find the pattern of association among the indicators of dataset

## Objective
Finding a pattern of association among the indicators of the given dataset using numerical association rules which are generated via genetic algorithm

## Note
This project is similar to the Research paper that I have co-authored. You can check out the paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-022-11265-4
